# IT
### Designed and created a robust simulation network system for an organization.
## Used:
#### 1- Spanning Tree Protocol -> for loop prevention, efficient network path selection, and specify root and secondary switches.
#### 2- Rapid PVST -> creates a separate spanning tree instance for each VLAN, convergence times, and close blocking time between switches.
#### 3- Port Fast -> enables fast transition of a switch port from blocking to forwarding state that closes blocking time between switch and PC.
#### 4- Port Security -> restricts access based on MAC addresses, allowing administrators to control which devices can connect to a specific switch port and has 3 types shut down(default), protect, and restrict.
#### 5- Subnetting -> process of dividing an IP network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks for improved address allocation, reduced broadcast domains, and determining parent IP, first IP, last IP, and broadcast IP.
#### 6- Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) -> method of segmenting a physical network into multiple logical networks, enabling separate broadcast domains, and improved network management and security.
#### 7- VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) -> facilitates the distribution and synchronization of VLAN information among switches in a network and has 3 types server, client, and transparent.
#### 8- Channel Group -> combines multiple physical interfaces into a logical bundle, increasing bandwidth, providing redundancy in network connections, and accepting more than one cable between switches.
#### 9- VLAN routing -> enabling communication between distinct Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) using routing devices to facilitate inter-VLAN traffic.
#### 10- Using Cisco program.
